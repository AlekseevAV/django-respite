CHANGELOG

v0.6.1
- Fixed a bug that caused views with no prefix to be routed incorrectly
- Fixed a bug that caused the regular expressions to allow arbitrary input between the prefix and action (e.g. news/articles/FOO/index.html).

v0.6
- Fixed a bug that caused an empty prefix to produce URLs with double slashes.
- The 'View' class has been renamed to 'Views'.
- The trailing slash of the 'resource' function's 'prefix' argument is no longer implicit.
- The trailing slash of the 'View' class' 'template_path' property is no longer implicit.

v0.5
- URL pattern names are now prefixed with the model's application name (e.g. 'edit_news_article').

v0.4
- Custom actions may now be routed by HTTP method.
